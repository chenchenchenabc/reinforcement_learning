Create an HTML page that generates a grid map and allows users to interact with it by setting start and end points, adding barriers, and running a value iteration algorithm for pathfinding. The page should include the following features:

1.Grid Generation:

Users should be able to choose a grid size (between 5 and 9) through an input field and a button that generates the grid.

The grid should consist of clickable cells that allow the user to interact with them.

2.Interaction Modes:

There should be buttons to toggle between:

Setting the start and end points on the grid.

Adding barriers to the grid.

Starting a value iteration algorithm.

3.Visuals:

The start point should be highlighted in green.

The end point should be highlighted in red.

Barriers should be highlighted in gray.

Each grid cell should show the best action (up, down, left, or right) and the value (V(s)) of that cell from the value iteration algorithm.

4.JavaScript Functions:

Generate a grid based on the input size.

Allow users to set start and end points by clicking on grid cells.

Allow users to add barriers by clicking on grid cells (with a limit on the number of barriers).

Implement a value iteration algorithm that updates the grid values based on actions and rewards.

Draw the grid and update the values after the value iteration is complete.

5.Styles:

The grid should have clear, defined borders.

The arrows indicating actions and the value text should be clearly visible within each grid cell.

Also, include the necessary JavaScript code for implementing value iteration, handling grid updates, and performing the user interactions like setting the start, end, and barriers.
